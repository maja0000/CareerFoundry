npm i + npm start :)

### NOTE

#### With more time I'd like to add/ change :

1. refacture coursePage.js - it's long and hard to read (break down to another custom hook with fetch and UI components)
2. spinner instead of "Loading..." message
3. refacture css

- more smootly responsive design
- more elements sharing the same properties
- nice onClick scroll transition to the course details + would hide the rest of courses
- nicer design in general ;)

4. refacture router - becuse i pass data through the link I'm not able to change the url without problems
5. refacture currency handeling (would save the values to variables and then use them)
6. add the commented out function that calculates the saved money
7. add env file and hide the API key :)
